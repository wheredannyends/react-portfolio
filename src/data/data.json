			"I am a Front-end Developer based in Vancouver, BC. I love transforming problems into beautiful, intuitive user-interfaces. I am always looking for ways to further my craft, and looking for new projects to explore.",
			"During my time in the Digital Design and Development program at BCIT, I learned how to take small ideas, design them with the user in mind, develop them into websites and web applications, and market the finished product. I excelled in the program, receiving the Peter Campin Memorial Award for academic excellence and leadership. I was also chosen as our class president, and represented our school and program at multiple events.",
